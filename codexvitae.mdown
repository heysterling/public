## How to play

3. **Every year:** On your birthday, read Review Every Year

## Review Every Day
Things I’d like to have primed in my brain every morning. Basically attempts to set a part of my brain to always be on the lookout for specific things that I want to be sure to catch. Use my subconscious to my advantage. 

1. **The soloverse:** What I think is the universe is actually my mental model of the universe (the soloverse). Don't forget.
2. **Anomalies:** Notice inconsistencies between what I expect to see and what I actually see. Resist the urge to move these anomalies into the trash bin. 
3. **Quality time:** Always look for new ways to enjoy quality time with myself, other people, and my interests.
4. **Levitas:** The opposite of gravitas. 
5. **Lucidity:** This is happening.
