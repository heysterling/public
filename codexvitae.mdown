#Just a pleasant saturday afternoon

#codex vitae (idea and format stolen from @buster

*from @buster*
This is an idea coined by Robin Sloan in his book [Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore](http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Penumbras-24-Hour-Bookstore-Novel/dp/1250037751). The idea is that you write a book, the Codex Vitae or Book of Life, that represents everything you have learned in your life. And it gets stored and read by a privileged few upon your death. Expanding a bit further on it, I think this is a great way of thinking about self-expression and capturing the meaning that we create in our lives. 

Posts about this topic: [What would you write in your codex vitae](http://branch.com/b/what-would-you-write-in-your-codex-vitae).

## How to play
1. **Every day:** In the morning, read Review Every Day
2. **Every month:** On the 1st of every month, read Review Every Month
3. **Every year:** On your birthday, read Review Every Year

## Daily basic principles
Things I'd like to have primed in my brain every morning. Basically attempts to set a part of my brain to always be on the lookout for specific things that I want to be sure to catch. Use my subconscious to my advantage.

1. **Respect both your time and that of others:** Spend less time with people who say no and more with people who say yes.
2. **Be open and don't hide from people:** Many people can tell what you're going to say before you finish a sentence. Be concise and look people in the eye. Use your words as a setup to allow the other person to say something meaningful to them.
3. **Support other people:** Look at your actions as opportunities to help other people look good. Resistance makes you look bad; so does talking shit and complaining.
4. **Wake up:** This moment will not happen again, but there are many more to come.
5. **Be fearless, and decisive:** Fear is an artifact of evolution. We have very little need for it any more. Indecision is a byproduct of fear.
6. **"I don't know":** It's a very strong character trait to say you don't know enough about the subject to have an opinion. It's also at odds with the way my peers live.
7. **Say "I" less, and more "we" and "you" more:**
